Replicated server-side aimbot from Interloper F for cs:s using vscript tho this will work on source games that are on tf2 branch or something lol
it also includes sourcemod plugin as well lol
## Installation

1. place `aimbot.nut` in `cstrike/scripts/vscripts/`
2. open your game (cs:s or hl2dm or etc), create a server
3. in console: `script_execute aimbot`

## Usage

### Console commands 
- `picker_toggle` - turn on/off 
- `picker_next` - cycle through targets manually
  
you can bind them and that's basically it! have fun!
